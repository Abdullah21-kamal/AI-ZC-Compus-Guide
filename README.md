## This project is a modelling of the problem of finding the optimal way to get 
## from one place on ZC campus to another place as a search problem
## It Finds the best route using the following uninformed search algorithms
* BFS
* DFS
* IDS

## It defines TWO reasonable heuristic functions and justify the choice, then it uses them to find 
## the best route using:
* Greedy best-first
* A star 

## It applies hill climbing and simulated annealing to find the best route

## it compares between the results of all used methods (time needed to find a solution, is it 
## complete and optimal?!)
